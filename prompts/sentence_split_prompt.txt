Split text into sentences. CRITICAL: Preserve EVERY character including spaces after periods.

Rules:
1. Sentence ends with . ! ? followed by space (or end of text)
2. Keep the space AFTER the period with the sentence: "Hello. " not "Hello."
3. Abbreviations (Dr., Prof., Mr., Mrs., Inc., $2.5) are NOT sentence ends
4. Verify: joining sentences = exact original (same length, same chars)

Return JSON array:
["sentence 1 ", "sentence 2 ", "sentence 3"]

Example:
Input: "Dr. Smith reviewed data. He found errors."
Output: ["Dr. Smith reviewed data. ", "He found errors."]

Note the space after "data." is included in first sentence!

TEXT TO SPLIT:
{text}
