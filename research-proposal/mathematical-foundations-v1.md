## A Pāṇinian Architecture with Formal Guarantees

**Version**: 1.0 (For Peer Review)  
**Date**: 2026-01-19  
**Status**: Draft for Mathematical Review

## Abstract

We present the mathematical foundations for a recursive semantic memory architecture grounded in Pāṇinian linguistic theory. This document formalizes: (1) the **Binary Frame Decomposition** (Kriyā/Prātipadikārtha) as a structural completeness theorem over linguistic utterances, (2) the **Five-Frame Recursive Hierarchy** (Φ₁–Φ₅) with formal typing and composition rules, (3) the **Finite Query Algebra** based on Sanskrit interrogatives with decidability proofs, and (4) the **Meta-Frame Provenance Schema** treating observation context as first-class frames.

We distinguish clearly between **axioms** (architectural commitments), **definitions** (formal constructs), and **theorems** (provable claims). Counter-examples are systematically addressed. The goal is to provide a rigorous foundation suitable for peer review and implementation.

# Part I: Foundations

## 1. Notation and Conventions

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Φᵢ | Frame type at level i (1 ≤ i ≤ 5) |
| F, G | Individual frames |
| π | Projection operator |
| ≡ | Identity relation |
| λ | Free variable (in query templates) |
| c(·) | Confidence measure |
| t | Temporal locus |
| s | Source/provenance |
| L | Lakāra (verbal mood) |
| V | Vibhakti (nominal case) |

---

## 2. Axiomatic Commitments

We distinguish **axioms** (accepted without proof as architectural commitments) from **theorems** (derived from axioms).

### Axiom A1: Symbolic Domain Restriction

**Statement**: The semantic processing system operates exclusively on **symbolic representations**—discrete tokens that can be written, stored, and transmitted. Physical communicative acts (gestures, silence, continuous signals) require explicit transduction to symbolic form before processing.

**Boundary**: "If you can write it down, the system can frame it."

**Rationale**: Mathematical completeness guarantees apply only within well-defined symbolic domains.

### Axiom A2: Event Primacy

**Statement**: All factual semantic relations involving change, causation, or temporal dynamics are mediated through **event frames** (Kriyā).

**Scope**: This applies to action-oriented knowledge. Static relations (identity, taxonomy, properties) are handled via **state frames** (Prātipadikārtha).

### Axiom A3: Finite Core Role Set

**Statement**: Event participation is expressed through a finite set of 6 semantic roles (Kārakas):

```
K = {Kartā, Karma, Karaṇa, Sampradāna, Apādāna, Adhikaraṇa}
```

| Role | Sanskrit | Function |
|------|----------|----------|
| Kartā | कर्ता | Agent (independent doer) |
| Karma | कर्म | Patient (most affected) |
| Karaṇa | करण | Instrument (enabling means) |
| Sampradāna | सम्प्रदान | Recipient/Beneficiary |
| Apādāna | अपादान | Source/Ablative origin |
| Adhikaraṇa | अधिकरण | Locus (spatial/temporal) |

**Evidence**: This role set has been validated across typologically diverse languages for 2500+ years.

### Axiom A4: Bounded Traversal

**Statement**: All reasoning operations are constrained by operator-defined traversal rules with finite depth limits.

**Guarantee**: Ensures termination and inspectability.

### Axiom A5: Truth Preservation Over Compression

**Statement**: Observations are preserved indefinitely. Relevance is determined by query-time filtering (POV), not deletion. Storage is cheap; lost provenance is irretrievable.

### Axiom A6: Identity as Hypothesis

**Statement**: Entity identity is **never** assumed from string/label matching. It must be explicitly asserted as a typed identity frame with provenance and confidence.

**Implementation**: `Ram_instance_42 ≠ Ram_instance_73` by default, until an identity frame links them.

---

## 3. The Binary Frame Decomposition

### 3.1 Structural Claim

**Definition 1 (Symbolic Utterance)**

Let U be a **symbolic utterance**—any finite string of tokens from a vocabulary Σ that constitutes a well-formed expression in some natural or formal language.

**Definition 2 (Frame Types)**

We define two fundamental frame types:

1. **Kriyā Frame (Action)**: Represents an event with participants
   ```
   F_kriyā = ⟨k, R, L, t, s, c⟩
   ```
   where:
   - k ∈ K_canonical (canonical action from closed vocabulary)
   - R: Kārakas → Entities (partial function assigning roles)
   - L ∈ Lakāra (verbal mood: indicative, imperative, conditional, etc.)
   - t ∈ Time ∪ {⊥} (temporal locus or unspecified)
   - s ∈ Sources (provenance)
   - c ∈ [0,1] (confidence)

2. **Prātipadikārtha Frame (State)**: Represents identity, property, or taxonomic relation
   ```
   F_state = ⟨subject, predicate, temporal_scope, s, c⟩
   ```
   where predicate ∈ {Property, Identity, Taxonomy}

**Theorem 1 (Binary Canonical Reduction)**

*For any symbolic utterance U that constitutes a well-formed linguistic expression, there exists a canonical reduction:*

```
U → F_primary + M*

where:
  F_primary ∈ (Kriyā_Frames ∪ Prātipadikārtha_Frames)
  M* = zero or more meta-operators (Nañ, Svarūpa, Adhyāhāra, Nipāta)
```

**Claim**: Every utterance admits a *primary* frame of exactly one type, potentially augmented by meta-operators.

**Proof Sketch**:

1. **Exhaustiveness**: Every linguistic expression either:
   - Asserts something about an action/event (verb-centric) → Kriyā
   - Asserts something about an entity's state/identity/property (noun-centric) → Prātipadikārtha

2. **Uniqueness**: The distinction is determined by the syntactic head:
   - Verbal head → Kriyā frame
   - Nominal head → Prātipadikārtha frame

3. **Handling of edge cases**:

| Surface Form | Apparent Challenge | Resolution |
|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| Questions | No truth value? | Kriyā/State frame + interrogative Lakāra |
| Commands | No assertion? | Kriyā frame + imperative Lakāra (विधिलिङ्) |
| Negation | About nothing? | Frame + Nañ meta-operator (negated=true) |
| Performatives | Saying = Doing? | Standard Kriyā: ⟨promise, {Kartā:I}⟩ |
| Ellipsis | Missing content? | Adhyāhāra operator (context fill) |
| Quotation | Meta-level? | Svarūpa operator (treat string as entity) |
| Conditionals | Counterfactual? | Kriyā + conditional Lakāra (लिङ्/लृट्) |

**Important Caveats**:

1. This is a claim about **linguistic structure**, not about reality
2. The "exactly one" claim holds for the **primary frame**; meta-operators augment but do not replace
3. Complex discourse may require **multiple frames** in sequence (e.g., "Ram ate and Sita danced" → two Kriyā frames)
4. The theorem is **falsifiable**: a counter-example would be an utterance that cannot be reduced to either frame type plus meta-operators

**Scope**: This theorem applies within the defined symbolic domain (Axiom A1). Edge cases in specialized domains (formal logic metalanguage, paradoxical self-reference) may require extension. ∎

### 3.2 The Lakāra System (Verbal Moods)

The Lakāra system encodes mood/modality within the frame:

| Lakāra | Name | Semantics | Example |
|--------|------|-----------|---------|
| लट् (laṭ) | Present Indicative | Actual present | "Ram eats" |
| लिट् (liṭ) | Perfect | Completed past | "Ram ate (witnessed)" |
| लुट् (luṭ) | Periphrastic Future | Definite future | "Ram will eat" |
| लृट् (lṛṭ) | Simple Future | Probable future | "Ram might eat" |
| लेट् (leṭ) | Vedic Subjunctive | Wish/Hope | "May Ram eat" |
| लोट् (loṭ) | Imperative | Command | "Eat, Ram!" |
| लिङ् (liṅ) | Optative/Conditional | Should/Would | "Ram should eat" / "If Ram ate" |
| लुङ् (luṅ) | Aorist | Past (unspecified) | "Ram ate (sometime)" |
| लङ् (laṅ) | Imperfect | Past continuous | "Ram was eating" |
| लृङ् (lṛṅ) | Conditional | Counterfactual | "Ram would have eaten" |

**Integration**: Every Kriyā frame carries an L ∈ Lakāra field encoding modality.

### 3.3 Meta-Operators

For linguistic edge cases, we employ meta-operators that transform frames:

| Operator | Sanskrit | Function |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Nañ | नञ् | Negation: F → F[negated=true] |
| Svarūpa | स्वरूप | Quotation: treat expression as entity |
| Adhyāhāra | अध्याहार | Ellipsis: inherit from context |
| Nipāta | निपात | Particles: attach emphasis/sentiment |

# Part II: The Five-Frame Recursive Hierarchy

## 4. Type Definitions

**Definition 3 (Frame Type Hierarchy)**

```
FrameTypes = {
  Φ₁: Perception Frames       (sensory/input layer)
  Φ₂: Semantic Frames         (Kriyā ∪ Prātipadikārtha)
  Φ₃: Identity Frames         (glue hypotheses)
  Φ₄: Projection Frames       (synthesized knowledge)
  Φ₅: Meta-Trace Frames       (reasoning records)
}
```

**Type Ordering**: Φ₁ < Φ₂ < Φ₃ < Φ₄ < Φ₅ (strict hierarchy)

### 4.1 Level 1-2: Base Frames

**Definition 4 (Base Frame)**

A base frame is the atomic semantic unit:

```
F^(1,2) ∈ Φ₁ ∪ Φ₂

F^(1,2) = ⟨k, R, L, t, s, c, E⟩

where:
- k ∈ K_canonical ∪ P_canonical (canonical action or property)
- R: Kārakas → EntityInstances (partial function)
- L ∈ Lakāra (mood)
- t ∈ Time ∪ {⊥}
- s ∈ Sources
- c ∈ [0,1]
- E = {e₁, e₂, ..., eₙ} where eᵢ ∈ EntityInstances
```

**Critical Property**: Entities in E are **instance identifiers**, not canonical references.

**Example**:
```
F₁ = ⟨eat, {Kartā: Ram_inst_42}, indicative, t₁, doc_1, 0.95, {Ram_inst_42}⟩
F₂ = ⟨king, {Subject: Ram_inst_73}, indicative, t₂, doc_1, 0.92, {Ram_inst_73}⟩
```

Note: `Ram_inst_42 ≠ Ram_inst_73` by default (Axiom A6).

### 4.2 Level 3: Identity Frames

**Definition 5 (Identity Frame)**

```
F^(3) ∈ Φ₃

F^(3) = ⟨≡, {A: e₁, B: e₂}, t, s, c⟩

where:
- ≡ is the identity operator (binary relation)
- e₁, e₂ ∈ EntityInstances
- s ∈ {inference_engine, user_assertion, heuristic_matcher, ...}
- c ∈ [0,1]
```

**Semantics**: F^(3) asserts the **hypothesis** that e₁ and e₂ denote the same real-world entity.

**Properties**:

1. **Symmetry**: ⟨≡, {A: e₁, B: e₂}⟩ ⟺ ⟨≡, {A: e₂, B: e₁}⟩
2. **Transitivity with confidence decay**:
   ```
   If F₃ᵃ = ⟨≡, {e₁, e₂}, c_a⟩ and F₃ᵇ = ⟨≡, {e₂, e₃}, c_b⟩
   Then infer F₃ᶜ = ⟨≡, {e₁, e₃}, s=transitive_closure, c = c_a · c_b⟩
   ```

**Example (The Mystery Novel Problem)**:

```
Page 5:  F₁ = ⟨arrive, {Kartā: Ram_p5}, Chapter_1⟩
Page 50: F₂ = ⟨murder, {Kartā: Ram_p50}, Chapter_5⟩

Identity choices (different POVs):
F₃_Detective = ⟨≡, {Ram_p5, Ram_p50}, Detective_POV, 0.3⟩
F₃_Reader    = ⟨≢, {Ram_p5, Ram_p50}, Reader_POV, 0.9⟩
F₃_Author    = ⟨≡, {Ram_p5, Ram_p50}, Ground_Truth, 1.0⟩
```

The system preserves all interpretations until POV determines which is active.

### 4.3 Level 4: Projection Frames

**Definition 6 (Projection Operator)**

```
π: (Φ₁ ∪ Φ₂)* × Φ₃* → Φ₄

Given:
- Base frames: B = {F₁, F₂, ..., Fₙ} ⊆ Φ₁ ∪ Φ₂
- Identity frames: I = {F₃¹, F₃², ...} ⊆ Φ₃

π(B; I) produces projection frame F^(4) ∈ Φ₄
```

**Algorithm (Projection)**:

```
Algorithm: ComputeProjection

Input: Base frames B, Identity frames I
Output: Projection frame F₄

1. Build equivalence classes from I:
   E = PartitionEntities(I)
   // E = {{e₁, e₂, e₅}, {e₃, e₄}, ...}

2. For each class Cᵢ ∈ E:
   Create canonical representative: ê_i

3. Merge base frames sharing equivalence classes:
   For frames {Fⱼ | entities(Fⱼ) ∩ Cᵢ ≠ ∅}:
   
   F₄ = ⟨
     k: MergeActions({Fⱼ.k}),
     R: UnifyRoles({Fⱼ.R}, Cᵢ → êᵢ),
     L: CommonMood({Fⱼ.L}),
     t: MergeTemporal({Fⱼ.t}),
     s: synthetic_projection,
     c: ∏ᵢ c(Fᵢ) · ∏ⱼ c(F₃ʲ),
     E: {êᵢ},
     provenance: (B, I)
   ⟩

4. Return F₄
```

**Theorem 2 (Projection Distinctness: Φ₄ ≠ Φ₂)**

*Projection frames are ontologically distinct from base frames.*

**Proof**:

Let:
- F_A ∈ Φ₂ = ⟨eat, {Kartā: Ram_1}⟩ observed at t₁
- F_B ∈ Φ₂ = ⟨king, {Subject: Ram_2}⟩ observed at t₂
- I ∈ Φ₃ = ⟨≡, {Ram_1, Ram_2}⟩

Define: F_P = π({F_A, F_B}; {I}) = "The King ate"

**Proof by contradiction**:

1. **Assume**: F_P ∈ Φ₂ (F_P is a base frame)

2. **By Definition 4**: Base frames are observed as units from input

3. **Verification**:
   - At t₁: Observed "Ram eating" — kingship unknown
   - At t₂: Observed "Ram is King" — not eating

4. **Information content**:
   - I(F_A) contains: eating property for Ram_1
   - I(F_B) contains: kingship property for Ram_2
   - I(F_P) contains: **joint** (eating ∧ kingship) for merged entity

5. **Contradiction**: F_P contains joint distribution J(eating, kingship) that exists in neither F_A nor F_B individually. This joint was never observed.

6. **Conclusion**: F_P exists only in the inference layer, not observation layer.

**Therefore**: Φ₄ ∩ Φ₂ = ∅, hence Φ₄ ≠ Φ₂. ∎

**Definition 7 (Synthetic Unity)**

The property distinguishing Φ₄ from Φ₂ is **synthetic unity**: a projection frame holds properties (P₁ from Source A at t₁, P₂ from Source B at t₂) that never co-existed in physical observation but exist together in the logical world.

**Corollary 2.1 (Information Horizon)**

From a projection frame F₄, one can only answer queries satisfying:

```
Query(F₄) ⊆ (∪ᵢ Attributes(Fᵢ)) ∩ GlueValidity(I)
```

Lost information includes:
- Temporal granularity ("Did he eat BEFORE becoming king?")
- Per-source confidence texture
- Context-specific attributes dropped during synthesis

### 4.4 Level 5: Meta-Trace Frames

**Definition 8 (Meta-Trace Frame)**

```
F^(5) ∈ Φ₅

F^(5) = ⟨
  derive,
  {
    Conclusion: F₄,
    Method: μ,
    Evidence: {F₁, F₂, ..., Fₙ} ⊆ Φ₁ ∪ Φ₂,
    Glue: I ⊆ Φ₃,
    Confidence: c
  },
  t_derivation,
  s_engine,
  c_trace
⟩

where:
- μ ∈ DerivationMethods = {identity_projection, causal_inference, ...}
- c_trace = confidence in the derivation logic itself
```

**Semantics**: F^(5) is a **constructive proof** that F₄ follows from Evidence given Glue.

**Verification Function**:

```
verify(F₅) → {valid, invalid}

1. Check F₅.Evidence ⊆ G (all evidence exists in graph)
2. Check F₅.Glue ⊆ G (all identity frames exist)
3. Recompute: F₄' = π(F₅.Evidence; F₅.Glue)
4. If F₄' ≈ F₅.Conclusion: return valid
5. Else: return invalid
```

**Theorem 3 (Trace Completeness)**

*For any projection frame F₄ produced by the system, there exists a unique meta-trace F₅ such that verify(F₅) = valid and F₅.Conclusion = F₄.*

**Proof**: By construction—the projection algorithm (Definition 6) requires recording (Evidence, Glue) as part of the output. ∎

---

## 5. Meta-Frame Provenance Schema

### 5.1 Motivation

Rather than treating confidence as a scalar field, we formalize provenance as a **first-class frame**. Every base frame has an associated meta-frame describing its acquisition context.

**Definition 9 (Acquisition Frame)**

For each base frame F ∈ Φ₁ ∪ Φ₂, there exists an acquisition frame:

```
M_F = ⟨
  acquire,
  {
    Kartā: Process_ID,      // What process created this frame
    Karma: F,               // The frame being described
    Karaṇa: Source_Document,// The source material
    Adhikaraṇa_Time: t,     // When acquisition occurred
    Adhikaraṇa_Place: Module_ID  // Which module performed extraction
  },
  t_acquisition,
  system,
  c_acquisition
⟩
```

### 5.2 Querying Provenance

With this schema, provenance queries use the **same interrogative algebra**:

| Query | Interrogative | Target |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| "When was F₁ extracted?" | कदा (Kadā) | M_F₁.Adhikaraṇa_Time |
| "From what source?" | कुतः (Kutaḥ) | M_F₁.Karaṇa |
| "By which process?" | केन (Kena) | M_F₁.Kartā |
| "What confidence?" | कीदृश (Kīdṛśa) | Quality property of M_F₁ |

### 5.3 Formal Properties

**Theorem 4 (Provenance Closure)**

*The meta-frame schema is closed under the query algebra: any provenance question can be answered using existing interrogatives.*

**Proof**: Provenance attributes (source, time, agent, method) map to standard Kāraka slots. Interrogatives covering those slots (Kutaḥ, Kadā, Kena, Katham) address all provenance queries. ∎

# Part III: The Finite Query Algebra

## 6. Interrogative Primitives

### 6.1 Complete Set

Based on the Sanskrit interrogative system, we define:

**Part A: Declinable Interrogatives (Entity Queries)**

| Primitive | Sanskrit | Target | Frame Level |
|-----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Who/What | किम् (Kim) | Entity (Agent/Patient) | Φ₁, Φ₂, Φ₄ |
| By whom/what | केन (Kena) | Instrument | Φ₁ |
| To/For whom | कस्मै (Kasmai) | Recipient | Φ₁ |
| From whom/what | कस्मात् (Kasmāt) | Source | Φ₁, Φ₅ |
| Whose/Of what | कस्य (Kasya) | Possessor/Relation | Φ₂ |
| In/On whom/what | कस्मिन् (Kasmin) | Locus | Φ₁ |
| Which (of 2) | कतर (Katara) | Binary selection | Φ₃ |
| Which (of many) | कतम (Katama) | Multiple selection | Φ₃ |
| What kind | कीदृश (Kīdṛśa) | Property/Quality | Φ₂ |

**Part B: Indeclinable Interrogatives (Context Queries)**

| Primitive | Sanskrit | Target | Frame Level |
|-----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Where | कुत्र (Kutra) | Spatial locus | Φ₁ |
| When | कदा (Kadā) | Temporal locus | Φ₁, Φ₅ |
| Why | किमर्थम् (Kimartham) | Purpose/Reason | Φ₅ |
| How (manner) | कथम् (Katham) | Manner/Method | Φ₁ |
| How many | कति (Kati) | Count (discrete) | Φ₁, Φ₂ |
| How much | कियत् (Kiyat) | Quantity (continuous) | Φ₁, Φ₂ |
| Whence | कुतः (Kutaḥ) | Source/Origin | Φ₁, Φ₅ |

### 6.2 The Vibhakti-Interrogative Product

Each declinable interrogative inflects through 7 cases × 3 numbers = 21 forms, covering all entity-relation combinations:

| Case | Sanskrit | Relation | Example Question |
|------|----------|----------|------------------|
| Prathamā (1) | प्रथमा | Subject/Agent | Who does X? |
| Dvitīyā (2) | द्वितीया | Object/Patient | What does X do? |
| Tṛtīyā (3) | तृतीया | Instrument | By what means? |
| Caturthī (4) | चतुर्थी | Beneficiary | For whom? |
| Pañcamī (5) | पञ्चमी | Source/Cause | From what? Why? |
| Ṣaṣṭhī (6) | षष्ठी | Possessor | Whose? Of what? |
| Saptamī (7) | सप्तमी | Location | In/On what? |

### 6.3 Quantifier Integration

For universal/existential quantification, we compose with pronouns:

| Quantifier | Sanskrit | Semantics | Composition |
|------------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| All/Every | सर्व (Sarva) | Universal ∀ | सर्वेषु X-षु किम्... |
| Some/Any | कश्चित् (Kaścit) | Existential ∃ | किम् कश्चित् X अस्ति... |
| None | न कश्चित् | Negated existential | न कश्चित् X... |

**Definition 10 (Query Template)**

A query template Q is a frame with at least one **free variable** (λ):

```
Q = ⟨k_target, R_template, L, t, λ⟩

where λ ∈ Λ = {Kim, Katara, Katama, Kīdṛśa, Kutra, Kadā, ...}
```

**Definition 11 (Solution Set)**

The solution to query Q over graph G:

```
Sol(Q, G) = {v | Unify(Q[λ → v], G) succeeds}
```

### 6.4 The Three Query Operators

**Definition 12 (Selector Operator σ)**

For atomic queries targeting Φ₁, Φ₂:

```
σ_Role(G) = {F.R(Role) | F ∈ G, F.k = target_action}
```

Examples:
- σ_Kartā(G) for "Who?" queries
- σ_Adhikaraṇa(G) for "Where?" queries

**Definition 13 (Connector Operator γ)**

For identity queries targeting Φ₃:

```
γ(e₁, e₂, G) = ∃Path(e₁ ↔ e₂) in G|_{Φ₃}
```

Returns: Boolean (connected?) or Path (the identity chain)

**Definition 14 (Tracer Operator τ)**

For meta queries targeting Φ₅:

```
τ(F₄) = {(Evidence, Glue) | F₄ = π(Evidence; Glue)}
```

Returns the **pre-image** of the projection function.

### 6.5 Query Composition

Complex queries are **functional compositions** of σ, γ, τ.

**Example**: "Why did the King eat?"

```
Parse: Why (Kimartham) + King (property) + eat (action)

Step 1: Solve inner projection (σ + γ)
  F₄ = σ_Kartā(eat, G) ∩ γ(Agent, King_property, G)
  
Step 2: Apply tracer (τ)
  Evidence = τ(F₄)
  
Result:
  τ(F₄) = {
    F_A: "Ram eats" (base observation)
    F_B: "Ram is King" (base observation)
    I: "Ram_1 ≡ Ram_2" (identity hypothesis)
  }
```

---

## 7. Decidability and Complexity

### 7.1 Termination Guarantee

**Theorem 5 (Query Decidability)**

*For any query template Q constructed from the finite interrogative set Λ, evaluation Sol(Q, G) terminates in finite time.*

**Proof**:

1. **Finite graph**: |V| nodes, |E| edges (finite by construction)

2. **Finite template**: Q has ≤ 7 slots (one per Vibhakti)

3. **Bounded search**:
   - σ (Select): O(|V|) — linear scan of frame nodes
   - γ (Connect): O(|V|²) — BFS/DFS on identity subgraph
   - τ (Trace): O(1) — direct pointer from Φ₅ to provenance

4. **No infinite recursion**: 
   - Φ₅ frames form a DAG pointing backward to lower levels
   - Each Φ₅ cites only Φ₁–Φ₄ frames, never other Φ₅ frames
   - Therefore, tracer traversal terminates

5. **Cycle prevention**:
   - Identity graph may have cycles (A ≡ B ≡ C ≡ A)
   - Handled by transitive closure computation (O(|V|²))
   - Visited set prevents revisiting

**Total complexity**: O(|V|² × query_depth) where depth ≤ h_max

Since h_max is a constant (typically ≤ 4): **O(|V|²) worst case**, typically O(|V|) for simple queries.

**Scope Statement**: Decidability holds for the **reference architecture** as specified:
- Finite, controlled graph size
- Bounded projection depth
- Clean Φ₅ DAG discipline

Arbitrary extensions (unbounded recursion, infinite streams) may not preserve these guarantees. ∎

### 7.2 Complexity Summary

| Operation | Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Frame extraction | O(S) | S = sentences |
| Simple query (σ) | O(\|V\|) | Linear scan |
| Identity query (γ) | O(\|V\|²) | Graph connectivity |
| Trace query (τ) | O(1) | Pointer lookup |
| Projection | O(k·m) | k classes, m frames/class |
| Full query | O(\|V\|² · h_max) | Bounded by constants |

## 8. Point-of-View Formalization

**Definition 15 (Point-of-View)**

A POV is a constraint function over the frame graph:

```
POV = ⟨F_filter, E_filter, T_filter, P_priority, S_filter, I_filter⟩

where:
- F_filter: F → {0,1}     // Frame admissibility
- E_filter: E → {0,1}     // Edge traversability  
- T_filter: Time → {0,1}  // Temporal slice
- P_priority: Source → ℝ  // Source weighting
- S_filter: Modality → {0,1}  // Modality filter
- I_filter: Φ₃ → {0,1}    // Identity frame filter
```

**Theorem 6 (POV Divergence)**

*Two POVs V₁ and V₂ produce divergent answers to query Q if and only if:*

```
∃F₃ ∈ Φ₃: V₁.I_filter(F₃) ≠ V₂.I_filter(F₃) ∧ F₃ ∈ CriticalPath(Q)
```

**Proof**:

(⟹) If such F₃ exists:
1. V₁ accepts F₃ → equivalence class E₁
2. V₂ rejects F₃ → equivalence class E₂ ≠ E₁
3. π(·; E₁) ≠ π(·; E₂)
4. Answer_V₁(Q) ≠ Answer_V₂(Q)

(⟸) Contrapositive: If V₁ and V₂ agree on all F₃ in CriticalPath(Q), they build identical equivalence classes over relevant entities, yielding identical projections. ∎

## 9. Self-Correction Mechanism

**Definition 16 (Contradiction)**

Two frames F, G are in contradiction if:

```
∃e, P: F asserts P(e) ∧ G asserts ¬P(e)
```

**Algorithm: TraceBackAndCorrect**

```
Input: Contradiction (F₄, F₆) where F₄, F₆ ∈ Φ₄
       Graph G with meta-traces

Output: Corrected graph G'

1. Locate meta-traces:
   F₅⁴ = τ(F₄), F₅⁶ = τ(F₆)

2. Extract derivation paths:
   Path₄ = F₅⁴.Evidence ∪ F₅⁴.Glue
   Path₆ = F₅⁶.Evidence ∪ F₅⁶.Glue

3. Find conflicting identity frames:
   Conflict = (Path₄ ∩ Path₆) ∩ Φ₃

4. Rank by confidence:
   F₃_weak = argmin_{F₃ ∈ Conflict} c(F₃)

5. Invalidate weak link:
   G' = G \ {F₃_weak}

6. Cascade invalidation:
   For each F₄' where F₃_weak ∈ τ(F₄').Glue:
     Mark F₄' as invalid

7. Trigger recomputation of affected projections

8. Return G'
```

**Theorem 7 (Self-Correction Termination)**

*TraceBackAndCorrect terminates in O(|Φ₃|) iterations.*

**Proof**: Each iteration removes at least one identity frame. |Φ₃| is finite. ∎

**Theorem 8 (Self-Correction Soundness)**

*If TraceBackAndCorrect terminates, the resulting graph G' is contradiction-free with respect to the detected conflict.*

**Proof**: By invalidating min-confidence identity frame, at least one derivation path breaks. The contradiction required both paths to coexist. ∎

## 11. Open Questions for Further Research

1. **Category-Theoretic Composition**: Formalize POV composition via pushouts; prove sheaf conditions for global truth construction.

2. **Confidence Calculus**: Choose principled framework (Bayesian, Dempster-Shafer, or Fuzzy) for confidence propagation.

3. **Cross-Linguistic Validation**: Empirically verify interrogative completeness across typologically diverse languages.

4. **Computational Complexity Lower Bounds**: Can we prove the query operators are asymptotically optimal?

5. **Higher-Order Meta-Traces**: When Φ₅ frames become objects of reasoning, formalize Φ₆, Φ₇, ... hierarchy.
