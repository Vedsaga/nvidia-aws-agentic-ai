Dr. Elena Kowalski, who served as the chief neuroscientist at the Berlin Institute of Cognitive Research from 2018 to 2023, collaborated with Dr. James Chen, a computational biologist from Stanford University, on a groundbreaking study examining the relationship between gut microbiome composition and neuroplasticity in aging populations. Their research, which was funded by a €4.5 million grant from the European Research Council and a $2.1 million grant from the NIH, spanned seven countries and involved 1,847 participants aged 65-89. The study revealed that individuals with higher levels of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium longum showed a 34% improvement in memory consolidation tasks compared to the control group. However, this effect was only statistically significant in participants who also maintained a Mediterranean diet for at least 18 months prior to the study and engaged in moderate aerobic exercise three times per week. Dr. Kowalski's former graduate student, Maria Santos, who is now an assistant professor at the University of São Paulo, independently replicated these findings in a Brazilian cohort, though she discovered that the effect was mediated by the presence of a specific genetic variant (APOE ε3/ε3) that is more common in populations of European and South American descent.
The implications of these findings led to a pharmaceutical collaboration between BioNeural Technologies, a Danish biotech startup where Dr. Chen serves as scientific advisor, and Yamamoto Pharmaceuticals, a Japanese company specializing in probiotic therapeutics. Together, they developed a proprietary probiotic supplement called "NeuroFlora+" that combines the two bacterial strains identified in the original study with a prebiotic fiber blend designed to enhance colonization. The supplement underwent Phase II clinical trials in 2024 across facilities in Copenhagen, Tokyo, and Toronto, overseen by Dr. Hannah Osei, a clinical trialist who previously worked with Dr. Kowalski at the Berlin Institute. Preliminary results showed that 67% of participants in the treatment group exhibited improved cognitive flexibility scores after six months, but unexpectedly, the supplement proved ineffective in participants who had taken broad-spectrum antibiotics within the previous year, suggesting that antibiotic-induced dysbiosis creates a microbiome environment resistant to probiotic intervention. Dr. Santos raised concerns in a peer-reviewed commentary that the clinical trials lacked sufficient representation from African and Indigenous populations, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings, while Dr. Chen defended the methodology, arguing that the genetic homogeneity of the trial populations was necessary to isolate the probiotic effects from confounding genetic variables.
