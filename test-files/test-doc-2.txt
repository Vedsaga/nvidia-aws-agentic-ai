On Tuesday, Dr. Aris analyzed the new dataset from the 'Helios' probe.
He found a strange anomaly within the solar flare readings.
Aris immediately sent the telemetry data to Dr. Lena using the secure channel.
From her lab in Geneva, Dr. Lena initiated a deep scan with the 'Prometheus' AI.
The AI processed the information and identified it as an encrypted signal.
Prometheus generated a decryption key for Dr. Lena.
She successfully decoded the signal with the new key.
The signal contained a message from an unknown source.
Lena presented the findings to Marcus at the central command.
Marcus, who directs the entire lunar project, requested a full report from the team.
The team compiled the report on the mainframe and sent it to headquarters.
