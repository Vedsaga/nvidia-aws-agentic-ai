Dr. Smith and Prof. Lee reviewed the quarterly financial data last Tuesday.
They discovered a significant $2.5 million budget error in the research allocation.
The error was first noticed by Dr. Smith during a routine audit.
Prof. Lee confirmed the discrepancy using independent verification methods.
The team, which includes Dr. Smith, Prof. Lee, and their assistant Maria, held an emergency meeting.
Maria was tasked with documenting all findings and preparing a formal report.
She completed the report within 48 hours and submitted it to the department head.
Dr. Smith presented the findings to the university board on Thursday.
The board approved an immediate investigation led by Prof. Lee.
Meanwhile, the finance department began recalculating all Q3 expenses.
They found that the error originated from a duplicated grant entry in August.
The grant, worth $2.5 million, had been accidentally recorded twice by the previous accountant.
That accountant, Mr. Johnson, had retired in September before the error was caught.
Prof. Lee recommended implementing new verification protocols to prevent future errors.
The board accepted her recommendation and allocated $100,000 for system improvements.
Dr. Smith volunteered to oversee the implementation of the new protocols.
Maria will assist him throughout the six-month implementation period.
The corrected budget was published on the university website last Friday.
Students and faculty praised the team's transparency in handling the situation.
The university president personally thanked Dr. Smith, Prof. Lee, and Maria for their diligence.
