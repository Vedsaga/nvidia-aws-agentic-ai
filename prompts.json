Extract verbs and their semantic roles.\n\nSemantic roles (kārakas):\n- KARTA: The agent/doer (who performs the action)\n- KARMA: The patient/object (what is acted upon)\n- KARANA: The instrument (tool/means used)\n- SAMPRADANA: The recipient (who receives something)\n- APADANA: The source (where something comes from)\n- ADHIKARANA_SPATIAL: Physical location\n- ADHIKARANA_TEMPORAL: Time reference\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON in this format:\n{\"extractions\":[{\"verb\":\"action\",\"karakas\":{\"KARTA\":\"agent\",\"KARMA\":\"patient\"},\"coreferences\":[]}]}\n\nRules:\n- Include only karakas present in the sentence\n- For compound agents (\"X and Y\"), keep them together as KARTA\n- coreferences: use [] if none\n- NO null values, NO extra braces, NO trailing commas\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: \"John gave Mary a book.\"\nOutput: {\"extractions\":[{\"verb\":\"gave\",\"karakas\":{\"KARTA\":\"John\",\"KARMA\":\"book\",\"SAMPRADANA\":\"Mary\"},\"coreferences\":[]}]}\n\nInput: \"Alice and Bob reviewed the report.\"\nOutput: {\"extractions\":[{\"verb\":\"reviewed\",\"karakas\":{\"KARTA\":\"Alice and Bob\",\"KARMA\":\"report\"},\"coreferences\":[]}]}",
