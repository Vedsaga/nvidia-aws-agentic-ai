# NO MARKDOWN FILES - CODE ONLY

**NEVER write .md files.** Tokens are costly. All docs exist in `.kiro/specs/`.

**Write:** Code (.js/.ts/.html/.css), tests (.test.ts/.spec.ts), configs (.json)
**Don't write:** README, docs, summaries, guides, any .md files

**Exception:** Only if user says "I need a markdown file"
